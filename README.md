Welcome to the "Hit Balloons" game repository! ðŸš€ðŸŽ‰

## Introduction

"Hit Balloons" is an exciting and addictive game where your goal is to pop the right balloons to increase your score before the timer runs out. Test your reflexes, challenge your friends, and have a blast while doing it! This README will guide you through the game mechanics, how to play, and how the code works.

## Gameplay Highlights

- You have a limited time of 60 seconds to score as much as you can.
- Each correct hit adds 10 points to your score.
- Keep an eye on the displayed number and hit the balloon with the matching number to score.
- The balloon layout changes with every successful hit, keeping the game dynamic and challenging.

## How to Play

1. Click on the balloons with the displayed number.
2. Increase your score by hitting the correct balloons.
3. Beat the timer and challenge your friends to beat your high score!

## Code Overview

The game's core functionality is implemented in JavaScript. Here's a brief overview of the key components:

- **`increaseScore()`**: Increments the player's score by 10 points and updates the displayed score on the UI.
- **`getNewHit()`**: Generates a new target number that the player needs to hit and updates it on the UI.
- **`makeBubble()`**: Generates a set of balloons with random numbers and displays them on the UI.
- **`runTimer()`**: Initiates a countdown timer of 60 seconds. If the timer reaches 0, the game ends.
- **Event Listener**: Listens for clicks on the balloons and checks if the clicked number matches the target number. If so, the player's score increases, and the game continues.
